# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview 
This project was really interesting.  We were able to put in weather filters for our desired temperatures, which were between 50 and 55 degrees and then able to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.  Next we chose 4 hotels to create a travel itinerary and used the Google Maps Direction API to create a travel route in Great Britain for our cities.
